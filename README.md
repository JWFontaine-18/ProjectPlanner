# ProjectPlanner

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/JWFontaine-18/ProjectPlanner.git
	cd ProjectPlanner
	```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

For best results (especially with Firebase authentication), use a local server:

```sh
npx serve .
```

Or use Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

That's it! Your website should now be running locally.
